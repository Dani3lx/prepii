## Defining the Problem
Many job candidates struggle to perform well in behavioral interviews, not because they lack experience, but because they lack a clear way to prepare. Unlike technical interviews, which have established platforms offering structured, repeatable practice, behavioral prep is often ad hoc â€” limited to scattered blog posts, generic advice, or mock interviews with friends. This lack of a focused, feedback-driven system leaves candidates underprepared for a critical part of the hiring process.
